# Power BI Guided Project: Data Professional Survey

This repository contains the Power BI project files and documentation for a guided project completed by following the "[Full Power BI Guided Project | Microsoft Power BI for Beginners]((https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pixlHHe_lNQ&t=21s))" tutorial by Alex The Analyst

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of creating an interactive Power BI dashboard

## Dataset

* **Source:** `Dataset provided by AlexTheAnalyst (https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx)`
* **Type:** Excel

## Tools and Technologies

* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** The primary tool used for data analysis and visualization.
* **Power Query (Get & Transform Data):** Used for data cleaning, shaping, and transformation.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used for creating calculated columns and measures to derive insights.

## Key Features and Skills Demonstrated

* **Data Import and Transformation:**
    * Connecting to data sources
    * Cleaning and transforming data
* **Data Modeling:**
    * Creating relationships between different data tables.
* **DAX Calculations:**
    * Developing measures for key performance indicators (KPIs)
    * Creating calculated columns for enhanced analysis
* **Data Visualization:**
    * Building interactive dashboards with various visuals like:
        * [e.g., Bar charts, Pie charts, KPI cards, Slicers]
    * Implementing drill-downs and tooltips for deeper insights.
* **Report Publishing (Optional - if you published to Power BI Service):**


## How to Use

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    ```
2.  **Open the Power BI file:**
    * Ensure you have [Microsoft Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/downloads/) installed.
    * Import the downloaded dataset file.
3.  **Data Source Configuration (if necessary):**
    * If the data source is not embedded or if paths are absolute, you might need to update the data source settings in Power BI (Transform Data -> Data source settings). Point it to the `data` folder or the original source as specified in the tutorial.

## Learning Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience with the complete Power BI workflow.
* Improved skills in data transformation using Power Query.
* Enhanced understanding of data modeling principles.
* Developed proficiency in writing DAX measures.
* Learned to create compelling and interactive reports and dashboards.
